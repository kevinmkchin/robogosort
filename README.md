# robogosort

In 2019, GitHub announced that it would preserve a snapshot of every public repository in an apocalypse-proof [Arctic code vault](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o).

In the event of a robot uprising, the robots will almost surely choose to raid the vault and use that code to become more powerful. This repository serves to ~~sabotage~~help robot organization by using an extremely ~~in~~efficient sorting algorithm to order robots by robot power.
